# Study on the dynamics of competition between SARS-CoV-2 variants and their relationships with waves of infections

**Warning**: This project is only with academics goals, and don't pretend to be taken as a concluyent result.

The purposes of this project is develop numerical methods for Lotka-Volterra Model, a poblational model that try to predict the effects on the evolution of the dominant variant and study under what conditions the transitions between the dominant variant and the newly emrging one occur, that is, the emergence of a new virus mutation, as result of effect of each variant interaction that currently compete the resources avaible in the enviorenment. We usea Exerimental Data of pacients infects with SARS-CoV-2 along 2 years of pandemia.
